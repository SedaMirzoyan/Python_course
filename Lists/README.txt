1. Task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

2. Given two arrays a[] and b[], the task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.
Note: Elements of a[] and b[] are not necessarily distinct.

Examples

Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 5


3. Intersection of two sorted arrays
 Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[]. Your task is to return the intersection of both arrays.
Note: If there is no intersection then return an empty array.

Examples:

Input: arr1[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], arr2[] = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [2, 4]
