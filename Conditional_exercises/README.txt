1. Mark Even and Odd numbers

2. Check the status of integer
Given two integer variables a and b, and a boolean variable flag. The task is to check the status and return accordingly.

Return True for the following cases:

Either a or b (not both) is non-negative and the flag is false.
Both a and b are negative and the flag is true.
Otherwise, return False.

Examples: 

Input: a = 1, b = -1, flag = False
Output: True

Input: a = -182, b = -9121, flag = True
Output: True

Input: a = 5, b = 3, flag = True
Output: False

3. Trouble with angry friends
There are two friends, John and Smith, and the parameters j_angry and s_angry to indicate if each is angry. 
You are in trouble if both of them are angry or no one of them is angry.

4. Cat and hat

You are given a string str, you need to return True if  the words "cat" and "hat" appear same number of times in str, 
otherwise return False.
Note: str contains only lowercase English alphabets.

Example 1:

Input:
str = catinahat
Output:
True
Explanation: cat and hat both are present 1 number of times.

Example 2:

Input:
str = bazingaa
Output:
True

Explanation:cat and hat both are present 0 number of times.


5. You are given a number N, you need to print its multiplication table.

6. You are given a string str, you need to print its characters at even indices(index starts at 0).
Example 1:

Input:
str = DoctorPhenomenal
Output:
DcoPeoea


7. Given a number x, the task is to print the numbers from x to 0 in decreasing order in a single line.

8. Given a positive integer x, the task is to print the numbers from 1 to x in the order as 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, ... (in increasing order).

9. You are given a number n. The number n can be negative or positive. If n is negative, print numbers from n to 0 by adding 1 to n in the neg function. If positive, print numbers from n-1 to 0 by subtracting 1 from n in the pos function.

Note:- You don't have to return anything, you just have to print the array.

10. Given a natural number n, the task is to write a Python program to first find the sum of first n natural numbers and then print each step as a pattern.

Input: 5

Output:

1 = 1
1 + 2 = 3
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
