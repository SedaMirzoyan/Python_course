1.  We need to extract only extreme K elements, i.e maximum and minimum K elements in Tuple. T 

Input : test_tup = (3, 7, 1, 18, 9), k = 2 
Output : (3, 1, 9, 18)

Input : test_tup = (3, 7, 1), k=1 
Output : (1, 7) 

2. Sum of tuple elements

3. Row-wise element Addition in Tuple Matrix

Sometimes, while working with Python tuples, we can have a problem in which we need to perform Row-wise custom elements addition in Tuple matrix. 

Input : test_list = [[(‘Gfg’, 3)], [(‘best’, 1)]] cus_eles = [1, 2] 
Output : [[(‘Gfg’, 3, 1)], [(‘best’, 1, 2)]] 

Input : test_list = [[(‘Gfg’, 6), (‘Gfg’, 3)]] cus_eles = [7] 
Output : [[(‘Gfg’, 6, 7), (‘Gfg’, 3, 7)]]


4. Create a List of Tuples with Numbers and Their Cubes
