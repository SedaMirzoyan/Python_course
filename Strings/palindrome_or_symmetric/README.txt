Program to check whether the string is Symmetrical or Palindrome

A string is symmetrical if its first half matches the second half, considering the middle character for odd-length strings. 
A string is palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.


For checking if string is palindrome, user defined palindrome_module was used.
