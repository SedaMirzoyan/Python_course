1. In this question, we'll take a look at inbuilt string methods like title(), swapcase(), find(), strip().
You'll be given a string str and x, you'll perform various operations on them.

Example:

Input:
str = hello 
x = llo
Output:
hello 
2 
Hello 
HELLO


2. Given a string S, the task is to determine whether the string starts and ends with the characters 'gfg' (case insensitive). 
In order to complete this task, you need to utilize the string functions S.lower(), S.upper(), S.startswith('string2'), and S.endswith('string2').
By using these functions, you can check if the given string S meets the specified conditions of starting and ending with 'gfg'.

Example 1:

Input:
S: "gFgabcdEGfG"
Output:
Yes

Example 2:

Input:
S: "GgfhTnagfg"
Output:
No


3. Convert string characters to lowercase.

4. Given a string s, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. 
Words are separated by spaces.

Examples :

Input: s = " i like this program very much "
Output: "much very program this like i"


5. Given name of a person, the task is to welcome the person by printing the name with "Welcome". 
If name is "John", you should print "Welcome John".

6.  Given a string of braces named bound_by, and a string named tag_name. 
The task is to print a new string such that tag_name is in the middle of bound_by.

Example 1:

Input: 
bound_by = [[]], tag_name = tag
Output:
[[tag]]

Example 2:

Input: 
bound_by = <>, tag_name = body
Output:
<body>


7. The task is to make a new string where the string with longer length should be in between and 
the one with shorter length should be outside on front and end. New string should be like 
shorter+longer+shorter.
Note: It is guranteed that no two string are of same length.

Example:

Input: 
a = Hi, b = There
Output: 
HiThereHi


8. Determine if the string is a palindrome.

9. Determine if the string is a anagram.

10. Inside folder there is a code, which checks if input string is palindrome or symmetrical.

11. The task is to remove all duplicate characters from the string and find the resultant string. 
The order of remaining characters in the output should be same as in the original string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "geEksforGEeks"
Output: "geEksforG"

Example 2:

Input: s = "HaPpyNewYear"
Output: "HaPpyNewYr"


12. Reverse Words in a Given String.

13. Print even length words in a string.

14. Remove Letters From a String in Python (i'th)
